      <p>Each number in numbers (1 to 100) should be printed to a line. If the number is divisible by 3 it should say “Fizz” next to it. If it's divisible by 5 it should say “Buzz” next to it. And if it is divisble by 3 and 5 then it should say "FizzBuzz"
        next to it.</p>
      <p>I used the modulo operation which honestly I'd never heard of before but thx to google, I solved it and it tool about 5 mins!</p>
      <p>Questions for Ryan:
        <ul>
          <li>I chose to have separate span's for the ng-if. Is that the best way or would you have done something else?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>


      <div ng-repeat="number in numbers">{{number}} 
        <span ng-if="number % 3===0">Fizz</span><span ng-if="number % 5===0">Buzz</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
