Requirements
◦Your app must achieve a high approximation of the sketch (and colors are true to original!)

◦You must use the following image assets, which you can save to your project directory for this assignment:
◦ngMadLibs Logo
◦ngMadLibs Smiley face


◦You're free to create your own Mad Libs text from scratch, but if you want to use the text from the sketch, you can find it here.

◦For this version of the app, when a user inputs text in any of the inputs at the top of the page, the text at the bottom should update automatically. For instance, when you set the value of "female name" to "Sue" in the top of the interface, all instances of the {{female name}} placeholder text should be replaced with "Sue".
◦When you've completed this assignment, save it to GitHub, and publish a branch using GitHub pages like you did in Lesson 1. Share a link to the page and your GitHub repo on Slack and with your Mentor.
◦Be ready to discuss your app and the decisions you made with your Mentor at your next session.

Gentle Guidance
◦You'll need to use ng-model, ng-init, ng-app="" and {{ }} braces to complete this challenge.
◦In case it's not obvious, you'll need to link to Angular in your HTML file.
◦Consider focusing first on a pre-Angular version of the page. Figure out your HTML and CSS for the initial state first, and then layer on the databinding functionality.

Room For Improvement

After you've completed this challenge, you may find that ngMadLibs leaves something to be desired. Wouldn't it be better if the text in the story updated only after a user filled out all the word inputs at the top of the page and clicked submit? 

To achieve this functionality, you'll need to learn more about controllers and working with forms in Angular. The next lesson will tackle these concepts.
